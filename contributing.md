# Contributing to iRail/hyperRail.

Looking to contribute something to iRail/hyperRail? **Here's how u can help.**

Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the contribution process easy and effective for 
everyone involved. 

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing
this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue or assessing patches 
and features.

## Using the issue tracker.

The [issue tracker](https://github.com/irail/hyperrail/issues) is the preferred channel for bug reports, 
features requests and submitting pull requests, but please respect the following restrictions.

- Please **do not** use the issue tracker for personal support requests. Our [gitter channel](http://wwww.gitter.im/iRail/iRail) is a better place to help.
- Please **don not** derail or troll issues. Keep the discussion on topic and respect the opinions of others.

## Issues and labels 

Our bug tracker utilizes several labels to help organize and identify issues. 
Here's what they represent and how we use them. 

- `confirmed` - the issues that have been comfirmed with a reduced test case and identify a bug in iRail/hyperRail. 
- `feature` - Issues asking for a new featiure to be added. 
- `wontfix` - Issues that will not be fixed this time. It doesn't mean that we don't ever fix that issue. 
- `duplicate` - Issues that duplicate another issue.

For a complete look at our labels, see the [project labels page](https://github.com/irail/irail/labels). 

## Bug reports 

A bug is a *demonstrable problem* that is caused by the code of this project. 
Good bug reports are extremely helpful, so thanks!

Guidelines for bug reports: 

1. **Validate and lint your code.** 
2. **Use the GitHub issue search.** - Check if the issue has been already reported. 
3. **Check if the issue has been fixed.** - try to reporduce the issue using the latest `master` branch in the repository.
4. **Isolate the problem.**

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. 
Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. 
What is your environment? 
What steps will reproduce the issue? What browser(s) and OS experience the problem?
