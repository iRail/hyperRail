### Step 0: Requirements and clone ###

* PHP 5.5+ for Laravel project. PHP 7.0 or higher is recommended if you're setting up a new environment. The php_intl module is required to run this project.
* NGINX, Apache, or any other server software of your choice.
* Composer (get it here: http://getcomposer.org)
* Grunt (get it here: https://gruntjs.com/getting-started)
* Compass (get it here: http://compass-style.org/install/)

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iRail/hyperRail.git
```

Set up your server software to pass requests to the hostname of your choice to `public/index.php`

### Step 1: Install / Update dependencies ###
In order to install the dependencies you have to run:
`composer install`

When installing this for the first time, also run this:

```
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
```
and edit your `.env` after your own taste (e.g., you may want to switch development mode off)

### Step 2: Update bootstrap/start.php for environments ###

Optional, but can be useful.

### Step 3: make app/storage writeable ###

```bash
chmod -R 777 storage
```

### Step 4: Set up resources ###

 * `npm install`
 * `bower install`
 * `grunt`

### Step 5: You're ready! ###

Usually you should be ready to get started by visiting the hostname you have set up. If it does not work, log an [issue](https://github.com/iRail/hyperRail/issues/new). We'll help you out and fix the documentation for everyone else.

In case you just want to update the stations list to the latest version, run: `composer update`
