## Front end

Assets are compiled using Grunt. To set this up you have to run `npm install`, `bower install` and `bundle install`. This will install all dependencies you need to compile the source files.

To compile the files you can use `grunt` or `grunt watch`.

The first one compiles all assets, the later one tracks changes in the source files and compiles when needed.
